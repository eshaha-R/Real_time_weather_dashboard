This website is designed to provide real-time weather updates for any city you search for. As you can see on the homepage, the interface is simple and user-friendly. There’s a search bar where you can enter the name of any city to get weather details instantly. Once you search, the dashboard dynamically updates to show the current weather conditions, including the temperature, humidity, wind speed, and an icon that visually represents the weather.Below the main weather information, there’s a feature to display a 5-day weather forecast. When you click on it, you get detailed daily updates, including temperature, humidity, and wind speed, for the next five days. This feature is helpful for planning ahead, whether it’s for travel, events, or daily routines. I’d also like to point out that this website is responsive and visually appealing, ensuring a smooth user experience across all devices. It’s been a great learning experience to combine design, interactivity, and functionality into one project. In summary, my Weather Dashboard is not just a weather-checking tool but also a showcase of how coding can create interactive and useful solutions.
